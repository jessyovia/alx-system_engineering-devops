# Attack is the Best Defense

This project delves into the realms of security, focusing on network sniffing and ARP spoofing techniques. By gaining insights into these advanced concepts, you'll develop a deeper understanding of network security and the potential vulnerabilities present in unencrypted communication.

## Background Context

This project is entirely optional but offers a unique opportunity to explore advanced security concepts. While not mandatory, completing any part of this project will significantly boost your project grade, provided your average score is higher than the score achieved on this project.

### Tasks

#### 0. ARP Spoofing and Sniffing Unencrypted Traffic

This task delves into the intricacies of network security by focusing on sniffing unencrypted traffic and extracting information from it. You'll leverage the telnet protocol to interact with SendGrid's SMTP server and analyze the traffic using `tcpdump` to uncover sensitive information.

You'll execute the `user_authenticating_into_server` script locally on your Linux machine and employ `tcpdump` to capture network traffic. Your objective is to identify the password used during the authentication process and document it in your answer file.

*Note: This script is not compatible with Docker containers or macOS.*

Refer to the [0-sniffing](https://github.com/jessyovia/alx-system_engineering-devops/tree/main/attack_is_the_best_defense/0-sniffing) script for detailed instructions and implementation.
