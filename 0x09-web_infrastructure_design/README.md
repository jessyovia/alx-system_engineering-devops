# Simple Web Stack

This project demonstrates a basic web infrastructure using a LAMP stack.

## Components:
- Server: Hosts the web application.
- Web Server (Apache): Handles HTTP requests.
- Application Server (PHP): Processes dynamic content.
- Database (MySQL): Stores application data.

## Domain:
The website is accessible via www.foobar.com, configured with the IP address 8.8.8.8.

## Issues:
- SPOF: Single Point of Failure with only one server.
- Limited scalability due to single-server setup.
