### Reddit API Practice Project

This project offers an opportunity to hone your skills in utilizing the Reddit API, enabling you to perform various tasks such as querying endpoints, handling pagination, parsing JSON results, making recursive API calls, and sorting dictionaries by value. It's designed to provide practical experience for individuals aiming to strengthen their API usage skills, whether for technical interviews or real-world scenarios involving data retrieval and manipulation.

#### Learning Objectives

By engaging with this project, you will achieve the following learning objectives:

- **Understanding API Documentation**: Learn to navigate and interpret API documentation to identify and utilize desired endpoints effectively.
- **Pagination Handling**: Gain proficiency in handling pagination to retrieve large datasets efficiently from APIs.
- **JSON Parsing**: Develop the ability to parse JSON responses obtained from API requests, extracting relevant information for further processing.
- **Recursive API Calls**: Implement recursive API calls for iterative data retrieval, enabling efficient extraction of nested or related data.
- **Dictionary Sorting**: Learn how to sort dictionaries by their values, a fundamental skill in data manipulation tasks.

#### Requirements

To ensure adherence to best practices and standards, the project comes with specific requirements:

- **Editors**: Use vi, vim, or emacs for coding purposes.
- **Environment**: All files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python 3.4.3.
- **File Endings**: Ensure all files end with a newline character.
- **Shebang Line**: The first line of all files should be `#!/usr/bin/python3`.
- **Library Imports**: Organize imported libraries alphabetically for clarity and consistency.
- **README.md**: Include a comprehensive README.md file at the root of the project folder.
- **PEP 8 Style**: Adhere to the PEP 8 style guide for writing Python code, ensuring readability and maintainability.
- **Executable Files**: All files must be executable.
- **File Length**: File length will be evaluated using `wc` to maintain code readability and manageability.
- **Module Documentation**: Each module should have accessible documentation viewable via `python3 -c 'print(import("my_module").doc)'`.
- **Requests Module**: Utilize the Requests module for making HTTP requests to the Reddit API.
